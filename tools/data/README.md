# Data Preparation for Rotation Detection

It is recommended to symlink the dataset root to `data/` under the project root.
If your folder structure is different, you may need to change the corresponding paths in config files.

Datasets commonly used in ABBSPO experiments:

- [DOTA Dataset](dota/README.md) [Homepage](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/)
- [DIOR Dataset](dior/README.md) [Homepage](https://gcheng-nwpu.github.io/#Datasets)
- [SIMD Dataset](simd/README.md) [Homepage](https://github.com/ihians/simd)

Other datasets supported by MMRotate are also compatible with ABBSPO.
